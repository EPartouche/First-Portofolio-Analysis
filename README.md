# Portofolio Analysis
This project represents a freely realized endeavor undertaken during Python courses as part of the ESSEC program. It showcases the practical application of Python programming skills acquired throughout the curriculum, demonstrating the student's ability to independently conceptualize and execute a project of their own design.
The project likely incorporates various Python concepts and techniques learned during the course, such as data manipulation, algorithm implementation, or perhaps even more advanced topics like machine learning or web development. By allowing students to pursue their own interests within the framework of the course, ESSEC's approach encourages creativity, problem-solving, and the real-world application of programming knowledge, preparing students for future challenges in their academic and professional careers.

# Task 1
Task 1 involved collecting data on at least 20 companies from diverse sectors. The task required gathering historical stock prices spanning the last five years, alongside the latest key financial ratios such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Return on Equity (ROE), and Debt-to-Equity ratio. This comprehensive dataset serves as a foundation for further analysis and insights into the financial performance and market trends of the selected companies. I decided to include some companies and sectors non-randomly (mandatory_tickers = ['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'LLY', 'UNH', 'MRK', 'EA', 'PARA', 'NWS'])

Selected 40 tickers: ['AAPL', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'LLY', 'UNH', 'MRK', 'EA', 'PARA', 'NWS', 'LYV', 'WBD', 'NFLX', 'POOL', 'RL', 'APTV', 'MNST', 'K', 'CAG', 'WMB', 'HAL', 'EQT', 'STT', 'HIG', 'RF', 'WAT', 'LH', 'ABT', 'PCAR', 'AMTM', 'UPS', 'SNPS', 'CSCO', 'TXN', 'LIN', 'CTVA', 'IP', 'ARE', 'EQIX', 'EQR', 'CMS']
